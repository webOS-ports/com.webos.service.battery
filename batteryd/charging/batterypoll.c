/**
 * @file batterypoll.c
 *
 * @brief This file implements the battery poll state machine with the following states:
 *
 * 1. Removed: This state implies the battery is disconnected from the system.
 *
 * 2. Inserted : In the "removed" state if battery is detected ( if battery voltage is positive), then the
 * battery state machine enters the "inserted" state.
 *
 * 3. Authentic : In "inserted" state if the battery authentication is successful, the state machine enters
 * the "authentic" state.
 *
 * 4. Notauthentic : This is the state reached if the battery authentication is unsuccessful.
 *
 * (Note : In all the A6 devices, battery authentication has been skipped from batteryd side, so by default state
 * "inserted" would iterate to state "authentic", and will never go to state "notauthentic")
 *
 * 5. Debounce : If in "authentic" or "notauthentic" states, battery is not detected, it enters the "debounce"
 *  state, where the battery is checked again thrice , once every second, and if battery is still not detected,
 *  it enters the "removed" state. However if battery is detected, it goes to the "inserted" state.
 *  However in case of A6 devices, battery presence or absence is notified by interrupt, and in that case, the
 *  "debounce" state is not used as this interrupt is reliable. So the state machine directly goes to the
 *  "removed" state.
